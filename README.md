# PlatformerGameGodot
This game started out as a tutorial I followed from [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) My intention was to learn the Basic of Godot game engine. As I was working on it, however, I and my team decided that we were going to make a game as our final project. I suggested making a platformer and they agreed. So here we are. The game is still under development and me and my team will keep adding onto it until our final deadline.
To play the game you could find and download the .exe zip file and play it
